		<h3><b>A simple story</b></h3>

		<p>I grew up in a small town right by the Gillette stadium called Walpole. I moved there when I was 7 and I had moved into a nieghborhood that was unlike my pervious home in Dedham. In Walpole I grew up playing soccer, baseball, and lacrosse. I continued to play lacrosse throughout highschool while running for our cross country team and participating in wrestling. Coming up to the end of my highschool career I had choosen a college to attend the next fall and unfornately it was not Northeastern. I studied at Lasall College, right outside of Boston, for a year then was able to transfer into Northeastern University. Beside school I had wanted to live in Boston most of my life because I felt that this city was full of culture and opportunities. Coming into my final two years in school I amazed by how much I grown and how much this world has changed in just a decade. </p>
